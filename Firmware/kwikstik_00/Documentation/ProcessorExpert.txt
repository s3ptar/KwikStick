Module "GPIO1"     (component GPIO_LDD)
   - GPIO1_Init -This method initializes the associated peripheral(s) and the component internal variables. The method is 
                called automatically as a part of the application initialization code.
   - GPIO1_Deinit -This method disables the device and frees the device data structure memory.
   - GPIO1_SetFieldValue -This method sets the output data value of the specified bit field.
   - GPIO1_GetFieldValue -This method returns the current input data of the specified field.
   - GPIO1_ClearFieldBits -This method drives the specified bits of the specified bit field to the inactive level.
   - GPIO1_SetFieldBits -This method drives the specified bits of the specified bit field to the active level.
   - GPIO1_ToggleFieldBits -This method inverts the specified bits of the specified bit field to other level.
   - GPIO1_SetFieldInputDirection -This method sets all pins of the field to the input direction.
   - GPIO1_SetFieldOutputDirection -This method sets all pins of the field to the output direction.
   - GPIO1_ConnectPin -This method reconnects the requested pin associated with the selected peripheral in this component. This 
                method is only available for CPU derivatives and peripherals that support the runtime pin sharing with other 
                internal on-chip peripherals.

Module "SegLCD1"   (component SegLCD1_KwikStik)
   - SegLCD1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SegLCD1_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.
   - SegLCD1_Enable -Enables the device - it starts the segment LCD module.
   - SegLCD1_Disable -Disables the device - it stops the segment LCD module.
   - SegLCD1_GetEventStatus -Gets current pending flags and clears them. This method is available if the interrupt service 
                property is disabled. This method must be called in polling mode, when is called method StartFaultDetectFrame.
   - SegLCD1_SetFrontplaneData -Set data to the LCD frontplane data registers. It sets/clears all used segments.
   - SegLCD1_GetFrontplaneData -Get data from the LCD frontplane data registers.
   - SegLCD1_SetBlinking -Activates/deactivates blinking of all segments (according to parameter BlinkMode).
   - SegLCD1_SetBlank -This method sets the blank display without affecting state of each segment. If supported by the LCD 
                module, the method allows alternate display setting. A segment state is set by method SetFrontplaneData or 
                SetAlternateFrontplaneData.

Module "ADC2"      (component Init_ADC_VAR0)
   - ADC2_Init -This method initializes registers of the ADC module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "PDB1"      (component Init_PDB_VAR0)
   - PDB1_Init -This method initializes registers of the PDB module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "eDMA1"     (component Init_eDMA_VAR0)
   - eDMA1_Init -This method initializes registers of the eDMA module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK40N512LQ100)
